# Git
Git is a distributed version control system. CB-Geo maintains a [git server](https://git.cb-geo.com) for software developed within the research group. The repositories on the CB-Geo git server are mirrored on [GitHub](https://github.com/cb-geo) and on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/groups/cbgeo).

Use a version control system to store your documents, files and codes as repositories on online git hosting sites such as [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/), [GitHub](https://education.github.com/) or  [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/software/views/bitbucket-academic-license.jsp).
